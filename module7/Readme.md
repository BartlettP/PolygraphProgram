# Description
I created a similar application to the FlightSchedule Application. This application stores information about polygraph examinations. I chose to make this application due to having some family members that are polygraph examiners and thought that this could be useful someday.
# Functional parts
- A text field for inputting the tested individual's name.
- A datepicker for the days in which tests have been conducted.
- A choice box for the type of test as well as the test result.
- A next test date is calculated for 6 months later and displayed in the table as well.
- I believe that I have handled validation. The table displays everything that is inputted into the fields that I have described above.
- I have included a menu with keyboard shortcuts to help navigate the application.
- A window opens whenever the fields are empty/invalid.
# Not functional
- I have included a print button so that maybe in the future I could print the table or export somewhere else.
